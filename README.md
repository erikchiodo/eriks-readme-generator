# eriks-README-generator

## Description

The goal of this Challenge was to create a command line application that takes user input and generates a ReadMe based on responses to prompts

## User Story

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input:

    > WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
    > THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

    > WHEN I enter my email address
    > THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

    > WHEN I enter my GitHub username
    > THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

    > WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
    > THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

    > WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
    > THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

    > WHEN I enter my project title
    > THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

    > WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
    > THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

## Contributors
Only the author (erik) worked on this assignment

## Tests
Look at sample readme (in distri) for more context. I tested my code with terminal with several console.logs through the program to ensure each use case I planned to address was covered
